## Want something implemented - open an issue/pull request
This is mostly a personal project which started with the purchase of a TouchBar MacBook.
I am implementing everything I find beneficial or useful and yes I do like the TouchBar (despite not the default one).

## Apple Silicon + Intel
PockV2 natively supports Apple Silicon but has only been tested on an Intel Mac.

## Thank you!
I don't have a support page but I use this project everyday and I like working on it!

## How To Enable
1. Unzip
2. Move Pock to your Applications folder
3. Open Pock
4. Accept
5. If you don't see Pock in your Touch Bar, go to the `Keyboard` pane in System Preferences and select "Touch Bar shows _App Controls_."


## Issue resolving
If some Control Center widgets (e.g. volume up/down) don't work, please remove the app from Accessability and Screen Recording in System Preferemces and add it again.
If it still doesn't work, remove the app from Applications, reset all premissions by running `sudo tccutil reset All` in the Terminal, restart, add it again and grant the needed Accessability and Screen Recording permissions again.

## Known issues
The brightness control doesn't work on M1 Macs.
The way M1 Macs handle displays is non-standard and buggy.
[This issue for Monitor Control](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl/issues/323) is one of the more active ones trying to resolve the issue, I will try monitoring it and implementing the fixes the people might come up with there.

## Widgets

<small>Includes five default widgets</small>

##### Dock widget

Your macOS Dock inside your MacBook's TouchBar, the core widget.
It comes with fully-functional badge support so you will not miss any notification.
More features can be configured in widget settings along with other preferences.
It now includes multi-window support!
*Enjoy your screen in full-size every time!*
